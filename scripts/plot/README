This directory includes scripts written to plot figures with qpAdm estimates for Ringbauer et al. (2024)
** All scripts in this directory were written by Tomer Peled, Ayelet Salman-Minkov, and Ilan Gronau
=========================================================================================

Things you need to make sure of before you run analysis:
   - install the follwoing packages for R: tidyverse plyr plotly
   - set up run the configuration script (../configureScripts.sh)
   - make sure that the main table with qpAdm results (combined-pars-models.tsv)
     is in the qpAdm subdirectory of the output directory (as specified in the config)

Each figure has its plotting script in R:
1) plot-fig2.R
   generates 5 PDF files (one per region) with summary of estimates for high coverage samples.
   These plots are combined to generate main Fig 2.

2) plot-figS3.R
   generates 5 PDF files (one per region) with all parsimonious qpAdm models.
   These plots are combined to generate supp Fig S3.

3) plot-figS4.R
   generates one PDF file with a 2D scatter plot of PCA-based and qpAdm-based estimates of North African ancestry
   computes the PCA-based and qpAdm-based estimates using the procedure outlined in the SI.
   Used as is for supp Fig S4.

4) plot-figS7.R
   generates 3 PDF files (one per group) with all parsimonious qpAdm models for Sicilian individuals.
   These plots are combined to generate supp Fig S7.
   Note that 2nd panel (Punic) is the same one generated in supp Fig S3 for Sicily.

5) plot-figSI_2.R
   generates one PDF file with all parsimonious "broad ancestry" qpAdm models for a select set of individuals.
   This is used for supp info Fig SI2.
   Note: uses the qpAdm data table broadModelsSelect-pars-models-with-p.tsv
         in subdir qpAdm/broadModelsSelect/ in the output directory

Scripts run in 1-5 above:

1) plot-fig2.R
2) plot-figS3.R
3) plot-figS4.R
4) plot-figS7.R
5) plot-figSI_2.R

Auxilliary scripts run by the scripts above (using 'source'):

* plot-settings.R.sav
    Sets up various variables for plotting scripts.

* prepare-data-tables.R
    Prepares data table before plotting

* filter-models.R
    Filters models based on a given set of categories and a region

* generate-one-qpadm-plot.R
    Generates a single plot with qpAdm estimates for all parsimonious models
    inferred for a given set of individuals (after filtering)
