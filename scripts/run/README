This directory includes scripts written to run qpAdm analysis for Ringbauer et al. (2024)
** All scripts in this directory were written by Tomer Peled, Ayelet Salman-Minkov, and Ilan Gronau
=========================================================================================

Things you need to make sure of before you run analysis:
   - install admixr package for R
   - set up run the configuration script (../configureScripts.sh)
   - place the follosing genomic data files in the dataDir path specified in the configuration script above:
       ancient_genomes.v54.geno
       ancient_genomes.v54.ind
       ancient_genomes.v54.snp

The analysis pipeline is executed via the following steps:
1) Execute prepare-qpadm-ind-file.sh
   to create a copy of the .ind file with pop labels that can be used in qpAdm analysis

2) Execute run-analysis-eastern.sh 
   to fit Eastern qpAdm models. 
   This script runs multiple jobs in parallel.
   Set maxJobs variable to the max number of jobs you with to run in parallel

3) Execute run-analysis-western.sh
   to fit Western qpAdm models.
   Can be run in parallel to step 2 above
   This script runs multiple jobs in parallel.
   Set maxJobs variable to the max number of jobs you with to run in parallel

4) Execute run-analysis-broad.sh
   to fit Broad qpAdm models to idnividuals without Eastern or Western models.
   Can be run only after steps 2-3 above have concluded.
   This script runs multiple jobs in parallel.
   Set maxJobs variable to the max number of jobs you with to run in parallel

5) Execute combine-qpadm-models.sh
   to combine the output files of steps 2-4 above into one file.
   Can be run only after steps 2-4 above have concluded.
   This script produces the main output file (combined-pars-models.tsv)
   used in nearly all qpAdm-based plots

6) Execute run-analysis-broad-select.sh
   to fit Broad qpAdm models to idnividuals for illustrative purposes.
   This script produces an output file used when plotting fig SI2.
   Can be run in parallel to steps 2-5 above.
   This script runs multiple jobs in parallel.
   Set maxJobs variable to the max number of jobs you with to run in parallel

Scripts run in steps 1-6 above:

1) prepare-qpadm-ind-file.sh
    Prepares ind file with appropriate pop labels for qpAdm
    - each analyzed individual has its sample id as a pop id
    - reference (right) pops and proxy source (left) pops are set

2) run-analysis-eastern.sh 
    Fits individuals with Eastern ancestry models

3) run-analysis-western.sh
    Fits individuals with Western ancestry models

4) run-analysis-broad.sh 
    Fits individuals with Broad ancestry models
    Only analyzes individuals with no Eastern or Western models
    Should be executed after run-analysis-eastern.sh and run-analysis-western.sh

5) combine-qpadm-models.sh
    Combines output tables for different qpAdm analyses
    (Eastern + Western + Broad)

6) run-analysis-broad-select.sh 
    Fits select individuals with Broad ancestry models
    Used to illustrate ambiguous ancestry

Auxilliary scripts run by the scripts above:

* launch-batch-qpadm-runs.sh
    Runs a qpAdm analysis on a list of targets in parallel

* run-qpadm-admixr.R
    Run qpAdm on a list of target individuals
     using the same setting for all of them

* group-out-tables.sh
    Groups qpAdm output tables into one output table

* expand-sources.R
    Expand output table for qpAdm to a given set of proxy sources.
    Sets ancestry proportions to 0 for non-participating pops

* compute-nested-p-values.R
    Computes nested p-values for all models given an output
    table for qpAdm 

* filter-parsimony-models.R
    Computes parsimonious models based on pre-computed
    set of valid models and their p-values 

* targets-with-no-models.R
    Computes list of indivudlas with no valid model in 
    a given output table of qpAdm
